# Java File-Downloader
Download Files with this jar

## Important information âš 
The project will be updated in the future, this version does not work as it should, because I specified my PC path and unfortunately you cannot customise it.

My plan for the future is to write a Youtube Downloader in Java, with the [YT-DLP](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) application. 
However, this still needs time as I want to keep it as user friendly as possible.
The user comes first, so there will be as many customisation options as possible.

## How to use?

Download the jar file and run it (Java version: 8).
Then paste the URL and the download will start directly.
After that a window will open that the file has been downloaded and you will be asked if you want to open it.
